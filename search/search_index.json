Here\u2019s why:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Node.js is the foundation:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Express is a web framework built on top of Node.js, so understanding how Node works will make it much easier to understand how Express fits into the picture.</p> </li> <li> <p>Node.js provides the JavaScript runtime on the server, handling things like file I/O, HTTP requests, and event-driven programming. Express abstracts much of this functionality and makes it easier to work with, but if you don\u2019t understand the basics of Node, you might feel lost when things go wrong.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Understanding Node Basics: Before you jump into Express, make sure you understand:</p> <ul> <li>How to use Node.js modules (like <code>fs</code>, <code>http</code>, <code>path</code>).</li> <li>The event-driven architecture and how Node uses a single-threaded model for non-blocking I/O.</li> <li>How to create HTTP servers and handle requests and responses in pure Node.js (without Express).</li> <li>How npm (Node Package Manager) works for managing dependencies.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Express Simplifies Node:</p> <ul> <li>Express is built on top of Node and provides a simplified API for handling HTTP requests, routing, middleware, and so on. It does a lot of the heavy lifting for you, making Node development easier and faster. However, if you don\u2019t know the underlying concepts of Node.js, you might not fully appreciate how Express is working under the hood.</li> </ul> </li> </ol> Suggested Learning Order <ol> <li> <p>Learn Node.js basics first:</p> <ul> <li>Understand Event Loop, callbacks, promises, and async/await.</li> <li>Learn how to create simple web servers using the built-in <code>http</code> module.</li> <li>Explore how to handle file operations, work with the file system (<code>fs</code>), and make network requests (using <code>http</code>, <code>https</code> modules).</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Learn Express.js:</p> <ul> <li>Once you're comfortable with Node.js, you can jump into Express. You\u2019ll see how Express simplifies the HTTP server creation process, helps with routing, middleware handling, and provides utilities for common backend tasks.</li> </ul> </li> </ol> <p>Example: Node.js vs Express</p> <p>Let\u2019s compare writing a basic web server in Node.js versus Express:</p> <p>Node.js (Barebones HTTP Server):</p> <pre><code>const http = require(\"http\");\n\nconst server = http.createServer((req, res) =&gt; {\n  res.statusCode = 200;\n  res.setHeader(\"Content-Type\", \"text/plain\");\n  res.end(\"Hello, world!\");\n});\n\nserver.listen(3000, \"127.0.0.1\", () =&gt; {\n  console.log(\"Server running at http://127.0.0.1:3000/\");\n});\n</code></pre> <p>Express (Same Server):</p> <pre><code>const express = require(\"express\");\nconst app = express();\n\napp.get(\"/\", (req, res) =&gt; {\n  res.send(\"Hello, world!\");\n});\n\napp.listen(3000, () =&gt; {\n  console.log(\"Server running at http://localhost:3000\");\n});\n</code></pre> <p>With Express, you don\u2019t need to manually set up headers, status codes, or handle the routing manually. Express makes it much simpler to write server code, especially for larger applications.</p> <p>In Summary:</p> <ul> <li>Learn Node.js first: It\u2019s the foundational knowledge that will help you understand how Express works. You\u2019ll get a better grasp of the underlying JavaScript and asynchronous programming concepts.</li> <li>Learn Express afterward: Express simplifies common tasks in Node.js, like routing and middleware, and it makes backend development faster and more structured.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"api/","title":"API overview","text":""},{"location":"api/authentication/","title":"Authentication &amp; Authorization","text":""},{"location":"api/endpoints/","title":"List of API endpoints","text":""},{"location":"api/error-handling/","title":"Error handling and response codes","text":""},{"location":"api/rate-limiting/","title":"Rate limiting and throttling","text":""},{"location":"blog/","title":"Index","text":""},{"location":"blog/#blog","title":"Blog","text":""},{"location":"core/architecture/","title":"System Architecture Overview","text":"<p>This section outlines the high-level architecture of the backend system.
